# The-Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon

### Description

This is the implementation of the backend for a service that computes the [Six degrees of
Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon). This problem can be restated as finding the shortest path between Kevin Bacon
and a given actor (via shared movies). THis has been achieved using a specific dependency injection framework (Google Dagger2) and Neo4j as the database management system

### Objective 

- Explore NoSQL/Graph Databases(Neo4j)
- To create REST API endpoints that are supported by Neo4j Graph Databases
- To utilize Git, Gitflow, and Code Style correctly
- Using enterprise design patterns, specifically dependency injection using Google Dagger2
- Learning and applying CI/CD

### TODO
- Complete `AppTest.java` under `src/test/java/ca/utoronto/utm/mcs`
